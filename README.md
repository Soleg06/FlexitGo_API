# FlexitGo_API

A one-file python3 program for reading and changing status of Flexit FTX devices through the same API FlexitGO App uses. This work is based on the good work of https://github.com/sindrebroch/ha-flexit

The program can be places in your own integration as one file, it doesen't requiere any installations

Pleace find example usage in the example file. The funcions usally return dicts that I have found the be useful in my other intregrations.
